euler is going to learn about the scientific understanding
euler encounters a girl at the arcanum - the female protagonist.  
need a name for her

she is a character who shows the most interest in the world. like a super nerd person

the arcanum has a good understanding of math 
but very little advancement despite since they do everything with magic
there is just no authority/interest in this

the girl mc spends all her lives doing such a thing.

he learns about the friction of how much they want to just do what the elder council does, and ultimately the Primarch.

Euler learns of the way they do things in this world
when you need labor - magic
when you need to do literally anything - magic

How strong you are at magic is based off of how much Dirma you have.
Euler is relatively weak because of this
Maybe he finds some way to use it cleverly? Instead of brute forcing maybe he learns techniques
Maybe the girl MC is good at that kind of thing, to an abnormal degree 


they don't really have much surplus because it's relatively easy to just do everything with magic on demand

they're kind of hedonists

they're not against the idea of optimizing/maximizing, but it's just something that is unintuitive for them 
it's unintuitive because with magic, scarcity is not really a thing they understand. 
they can understand it intellectually, but it doesn't feel real since even if it's real, it's to such an insignificant degree

Euler needs a reason to introduce the allure of technology 

Euler meets friction but in this world, he has authority to do such things once Arkhaios comes back 

After the introduction about life at the arcanum and maybe more building with him as an infant,
we can do a timeskip. to when he is maybe a teenager, (17?) and Arkhaios returns
