Mirari and I entered her - our - laboratory, after she gave me a lesson on a property of the crystals. 
One of many since the first time we stepped foot in, what I later dubbed the Hollows, together.
The laboratory, which had now become the place I spent all my hours, evoked a memory now aged a few seasons.

After I had started working for Mirari in more an official capacity, I had asked about her my schedule.

"So when do you want me to show up every day?" I asked, wanting to make good impressions. 

"Doesn't much matter to me. You can come and go as you please," she said as she shrugged nonchalantly. 

"When do you show up?" I asked, not wanting to fail what seemed like a test.

"I'm always here." 

"You don't ever go home?" I asked incredulously.

"I have a home," as she vaguely waved in an unspecific direction,"but it's too much of a hassle to come back and forth. so I just stay here. I have everything I need." 

"I'll stay here too then." 
As soon as I said this, I felt flushed, realizing that I have overstepped and invited myself in a crass manner. 
At least, it would have been the case back on Earth.

Mirari raised an eyebrow in a mused manner, but made no mention of my un-gentlemanly forwardness.
"Really? Ok, I'll show you to my rooms - our rooms now, I guess."

She brought me to the corner of her office, and around a shelf was a hallway, which I had never noticed due to the cluter in her office. 

Around the corner was... Not a bedroom. It was clearly a laboratory, with gadgets and gizmos strewn about. 

Mirari lead me further in past the laboratory and there was tidy area completely unlike her office.  
It was modest in size, but it felt cozy, and it didn't seem to be compromising in any amenities. 
A kitchen, comfortable furniture, a bed, and a door that was lit with sunlight hid what I now know are the bathrooms.

"This is home then?" I asked.

"It serves its purpose. It's simple but I don't need much else. You still sure you want to stay here?" she asked.

I thought about how companies that offered napping rooms and three meals a day were synonymous with overwork back on Earth.

I had no hesitations about being productive, and Tariel had made it clear to me that I had no obligation to call home or help her with her work. 
I found her words to be harsh, only in sentiment, but quickly understood that there was no ill will. 
My preconceptions from Earth were the only influence on my feelings. 

In this world, only Novas lived with their birth parents until their bodies matured. 
Most people had their own homes and and vocations from previous lives, and continued their lives without pause as Velars as soon as their bodies required no caretaking.

I enjoyed my time with Mirari immensely and I didn't shy away from work when it was fulfilling.

"Yes, if you'll allow it." I answered eagerly, after only a slight delay for my considerations.

Looking back now, I don't regret for a second of my decision then. I came to know this place as home and it was the most comfortable one I had. Maybe ever.
