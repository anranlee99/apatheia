"I'll take you today so you can find your way," Tariel said, adjusting the braid over her shoulder.

Before we left, she handed me a small leather purse that jingled faintly. 
It was bigger than my fist. I chuckled to myself when pictureing the imagery of a walking infant with a proportionally huge sack of money on Earth.  

"For lunch and anything else you might need," she said.

 After the Council’s decision, it was only a matter of time before I was put into the sort of structured learning that Novas received. 
 They had deferred it until I could walk without someone holding my hand, but now my unsteady toddle was apparently good enough.

When we reached the academy wing of the Arcanum, I saw it was nothing like the crowded classrooms I remembered from Earth. 
There were only four pupils, plus the tutor, who had a few Dirma curling across her forearm and jaw. 
That meant she was not ancient, at least by local standards.

The social aspect was not too surprising, but still not something I would've guessed.
No one was mean. No whispering, no side glances, no pranks. They greeted me with the same casual acknowledgment they would give anyone else, like it was completely normal to have a new student who barely came up to their ribs. 
I had been around long enough now to understand why. Here, physical age did not matter much. 
It makes sense: as Nova, they would have no prejudice on what is to be expected. 

Another note on the behavior of the Nova was that it reminded me of children raised by great great great grandparents.
Polite, calm, and careful with their words, but carrying an oddness in mannerisms that would have been described as "mature for their age" back on Earth, and maybe just slightly strange.

The lessons began with mathematics, though here it felt more like a branch of natural studies than the abstract discipline I knew from Earth. 
The facts given did not come with any tale of a past genius' wonderous findings, or how an equation led to a leaping advancement we take for granted now.
In this world, people did not build elaborate models or run equations on paper. 
If you needed to know a quantity, you simply measured it in the most literal sense. 
You simply found it by simulating it with Arcana.

The volume of a building, the decay rate of a material over centuries, the exact temperature at which a metal would warp, the yield of a crop field in the next harvest, the time it would take a river to flood its banks.
Anything that needed to be known could be, provided you had enough Arcana to do it yourself or the means to request someone at the Arcanum to do it for you.

It made for a very matter of fact approach to numbers. 
Calculations were rarely about prediction; they were about direct retrieval. 
You did not wonder about the answer, you simply pulled it into your mind and there it was. 
The results were correct and reliable, but the process lacked the showmanship of unveiling the curtain to reveal the secrets of a magic trick that made mathematics exciting for me.

History, though, was where things became interesting for me. They did not have a timeline the way Earth did. 
Instead, they measured history in the lives of the oldest person alive. 
At the moment, that meant one of the Council, but sometimes it meant the Primarch himself. "Before the Primarch’s last return" or "three aeons ago" was as precise as anyone seemed to need. 
Actual year counts existed in the archives of course, but no one here referenced them.

The tutor recited events that stretched farther back than all of human civilization, each one given the same brisk attention as a weather report. 

Then the founding myth.
"Arkhaios was alone," the tutor began, her voice steady and unhurried. "Omnis, moved by compassion, bore him a child. The rivers sprang from her tears. The constellations were gifts for the child to play with. The mountains were flattened for a cradle."

She went on without the slightest change in tone.

"The winds of the world were once locked away in a great hollow stone. Omnis split it open so her child could hear them sing. The second moon was hung in the sky to keep the child company when Arkhaios slept. In those days, the oceans were fresh water, and their salt came only when Omnis washed the child’s hair."

I glanced around the room. No smirks. No whispered comments. Everyone was listening as if she were describing something as uncontroversial as how to measure the height of a wall.

"The forests grew in a single night, so that the child would not have to walk far for shade. The first fire was not from friction, nor from the burning of wood, but from a spark struck by Omnis’s hand to light the child’s toys. The sun itself is said to dim once each age, just so the child can sleep longer."

By now I could feel my brain tugging at the contradictions. 
This was the same tutor who, only minutes ago, had explained lunar planting cycles down to exact intervals of moonlight, who could chart the shifting tilt of the planet over hundreds of generations.
And now she was talking about rivers born from tears and oceans salted by shampoo.

But no one asked how the mountains could be leveled without altering tectonic stability. 
No one pointed out that forests cannot grow in a night, or that the sun dimming would cause catastrophic cooling. 
They accepted it the way you might accept that the hero in a story always wins, not because it was logically airtight, but because it was the story.
Events that formed mountains, split continents, or rained fire on the Earth were talked about with no more emphasis than what was for lunch. 
When you had precise records that stretched hundreds of millenia, no single event was of great importance.
There was no deep dive, no cause and effect, just a polite nod to the past before moving on.

I suppose it makes sense.
They had no notion of extinction. If rigorous facts were needed, they could be found. 
Things either endured, or disappeared for a while before coming back. Why question it?

By the time we ended for the day, my head was full. Not with facts, but with the gaps between them. I could feel the question forming before I even realized I was going to ask it. 
As the others gathered their things and the tutor smoothed her robes, I stayed in my seat, heart beating a little faster.

I had a burning question for her.
