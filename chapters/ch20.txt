"Alright," I said. "In my world, especially with computers, everything comes down to precise instructions."

Mirari nodded, giving me her full attention. I was glad that she was taking me so seriously, but her gaze was putting on the pressure.

"And by precise, I mean that the fewer details I gloss over, the better the results will be," I continued. 

Sensing how vague I was being, I decided to give a practical example.

"Suppose that I wanted a recipe for producing a sandwich. What would it say?" I asked "You will be the programmer. I will be the machine. I will do exactly what you say... and only that."

I used my newly acquired Arcana skills to summon over more ingredients onto the table between us. 

Nodding with a blank expression, Mirari obliged.
"Ok, make me a sandwich."

I picked up the nearest crystal tablet from her desk, and set it squarely in front of her.

She looked at it, then at me. "What are you doing?"

"A... thing I’ve made available to you. Is it not a sandwich?"

Her eyes narrowed. "You know it isn’t."

"Correct," I said. "But the computer doesn't. You never told me what one is. Without the meaning defined, the best it can do is guess. And the fewer details you gloss over, the better the results will be." I smiled cheekily.

"In fact, all we need are the instructions you want me to perform. I don't really need to know what it is right?"

Mirari pondered briefly then began again, "Take the bread and place it on the table."

I reached for the entire loaf and balanced it lengthwise on its end, like a pillar.

"Not like that," she said, fighting a smile. "Lay a slice of bread flat on the table."

"Define slice," I intoned.

"A piece of bread whose thickness is a finger's width," she said. "Cut one from the loaf."

I lifted the knife and sawed off a wedge from the heel of the loaf-thicker at one end, thinner at the other. I set it "flat" on the table, the slope making it look like a lopsided ramp.

Mirari’s lips pressed together. "Fine. Now place tomato on the bread."

I picked up an entire tomato and set it in the middle of the slice like a ceremonial offering.

Her eyes flicked from the tomato to me. "...Slice the tomato first."

"No problem," I said, and began cutting it into thick, uneven discs, seeds spilling across the table. Without being told otherwise, I stacked the slices into a neat tower on top of the bread.

Her nostrils flared, but her voice stayed calm. "Place exactly three slices of tomato, lying flat, not stacked, and not overlapping."

I dismantled the tower, repositioned three slices into a perfect row, and sat back.

"Add meat," she instructed.

I lifted the entire stack of sliced meat from the platter and dropped it on top, half of it spilling off the bread and onto the table.

Mirari pinched the bridge of her nose. "Place one layer of meat, covering the bread and tomatoes without hanging past the edges."

I adjusted it exactly as stated. Still ignoring the uneven shape of the bread and looked at her expectantly.

"You get the point now, and I suspect I'm having a little too much fun," I admitted while sticking my tongue out playfully.

"It’s maddening," she said. "Like giving orders to a child who’s never seen the world."

"Exactly," I said. "And that’s the weakness. But it’s also the strength. Once you write out the steps correctly, it’ll do them the same way every time, without stopping, without getting tired, and without needing anyone to check its work."

She glanced at the crooked little sandwich on the table. "But I could've just made the sandwich easily."

"And how many sandwiches can you make? For how long? When I think about Arcana, I see it as just an extension of the person's abilities. It stops when they stop. It messes up when they mess up. You only have to get the computer right once, and it'll never fail."

Mirari tilted her head, her gaze sharpening. "So... we can combine the two. And they'll complement each other,"

"Exactly!" I bursted out in unadulterated joy. "I'm so glad you caught on quickly." 

"And what would we need?" she asked eagerly.

"A lot, I suppose," I said, now faced with realities. 

"We really just need a few things. Starting with a way to combine the two in a basic way. We could do it," I said, with some artificial optimism.

A slow smile spread across her face, the kind that made me certain she was already running ahead in her mind. 
"We have to do it!" she exclaimed, in a rare attitude that truly matched her juvenile body.

I wasn't sure if it would really happen, the fact that she felt as eager as I did made this the happiest moment of my life. Of all my lives.
