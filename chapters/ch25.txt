Life in Apatheia had a way of softening edges. 
Urgency was a word without purchase here. When nothing was scarce, when no hunger or deadline pressed, people simply let the current carry them. 
It was easy - dangerously easy - to drift with it.

I might have noticed sooner if not for Mirari. We had no shortage of work, and I had no time for mundane thoughts like how much time has passed, when every moment with her was electrifying. 

Repairs in the city, endless tablets to read, puzzles to dissect in the Hollows - it was enough to keep my mind sharp, enough to fool me into thinking I was moving forward. 
In truth, I was circling the same orbit, seasons blurring into each other until I stopped counting.

I don't doubt that some part of my mind was acutely aware of the time that passed, but I had no reason for any vigilance against the passing time.

More than seventeen sols had slipped behind us. 
I only noticed because I had been compiling the knowledge I’d gathered, making notes of when I had read each tablet.
The dates stacked up like fallen leaves, and suddenly I saw the years hidden in the pile.

That same sol, Mirari set a glass in front of me - amber, sharp-scented. 
"It’s what they give Novas when they leave the nest, I figured that we should celebrate it, since you never got one," she explained, her lips curving faintly. "To your first adulthood. In this world."

The amber burned my throat, but the fire that followed was not the drink’s alone.

Her eyes lingered on me a heartbeat too long. The lamplight traced her cheek, the hollow of her collarbone where her braid had slipped loose. 
I had always thought of her as untouchable - centuries older, wreathed in patience and wisdom. 
But in that moment she was close enough that I could see the faintest flush along her throat, close enough that the resin-and-smoke scent of her hair coiled around me like a spell.

When she reached across the table to adjust the glass in my hand, her fingers brushed mine. I should have pulled away. I didn’t. Neither did she. 
Her hand lingered a second too long, and in that second something unspoken bloomed between us - not study, not habit, but a taut, trembling charge.

We finished the drink in silence. Not the silence of study or fatigue, but the silence of something waiting to break.

Later, when the corridors of the Arcanum had fallen still, she led me wordlessly back to our chambers. 
The fire had burned low, throwing soft shadows that seemed to curl around us like a cocoon.

She stopped just inside the door, turning to me with that same faint smile she’d worn when she pressed the glass into my hand. 
Her eyes searched mine, as if weighing one last time whether the path before us was truly open. 
I had no words to give her, but none were needed. I stepped forward.

The kiss was tentative at first, a question more than an answer. Her lips were warm, faintly sharp with the taste of the liquor we’d shared. 
When I leaned into her, she responded without hesitation, her hand rising to the back of my neck to hold me there as though she feared I might vanish.

Her braid slipped from her shoulder, silken strands brushing my cheek. 
My hands, unsteady, found her waist. The thin fabric of her robe gave way to the warmth beneath, and she drew a sharp, quiet breath as my fingers tightened, uncertain yet unwilling to let go.

She pulled me closer, guiding me with a confidence born of centuries, yet the way she pressed against me carried something urgent, almost youthful - a hunger long held at bay. 
My inexperience was met not with indulgence but with reciprocity, as though she wanted this just as fiercely as I did.

Her lips trailed from mine to my jaw, to the hollow of my throat. 
The heat of her breath sent a shiver racing down my spine. 
I buried my face in her hair - it smelled of smoke, resin, and something faintly sweet, something wholly her.

We stumbled together toward the low bed, neither willing to break the closeness. 
When we fell against it, laughter almost escaped me - nervous, incredulous - but her mouth found mine again before I could speak, silencing me with a certainty that burned through doubt.

Her hand traced the line of my chest, slow, deliberate, claiming. 
My own hand, clumsy but desperate, mirrored her gesture. With my other hand, I followed the curve of her hip, the small of her back. 
Every inch of her seemed charged, alive, more real than anything I had known since leaving Earth.

The night stretched, time dissolving as it always did in Apatheia, but now for a different reason. 
Every breath, every touch, every shared glance became its own world, vivid and consuming.

When at last the fire sank into embers, we lay tangled together, her head resting against my chest, her braid undone, hair spilling like silver across the sheets. 
My arm curled around her, holding her as though I had finally found something solid to anchor myself to in this drifting world.

For seventeen sols she had been my teacher, my partner, the closest thing to family I could name. 
In a place where urgency dissolved into nothingness, she had been the one constant that kept me from drifting.
