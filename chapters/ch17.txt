Mirari moved like a conductor leading an orchestra only she could hear.
A flick of her fingers coaxed ripe, heavy tomatoes from the spindly potted plants in the corner, their skins splitting slightly from sudden fullness.
She sliced them in midair, wedges drifting toward a waiting plate where bread, cheese, and thin-shaved meats already assembled themselves under her unseen direction.
With a flick of the wrist, the scent of browning crust and melting cheese filled the room.
Her other hand guided a bottle to pour two glasses of something amber and fragrant without spilling a drop.

All the while, she spoke.
Not rapid fire, not distracted; her words came with the same precision as her movements, the kind that suggested she could have done all of this in complete silence but chose instead to fill the space with her inquiry.

"So," she said, as crystal shards of her Dirma shimmered along her temple in the shifting light, "what I want to know is how you came to ask that question. " 

With a sweep of her arm, stacks of notes and research tablets glided aside, vanishing into tidy piles on higher shelves. 
Beneath the clutter, a small coffee table emerged, clear and inviting. 
She pulled a low chair into place with her foot and gestured for me to sit.

"Well, I figured that I wouldn't have much Dirma," I started, "but I thought I might be able to do more if I found a way to do-"

She cut me off. 
"Let me rephrase. I want to know what even made you think of the possibility," she amended. 

The precision of her curiosity caught me off guard.
No one else here had asked why I thought the way I did - not Tariel, not the tutors, not even the Council. 
They asked what I wanted to know, but never how I arrived at the question in the first place.
In this world, this was the first time I’d encountered someone treating the source of my thinking as a subject worth examining.

"That’s... only natural to me, I suppose," I said at last, unsure if I had touched a taboo in this world. 

I figured that the people of this world had never shown cruelty, and honesty kept it easy for me to act natural.

"You see, I'm not from this world," I continued.

I told her about Omnis. The conversation in the place-between, the offer, the strange gift.
How I wasn’t a true Velar, that I’d never lived as a Nova in this world.
That my memories stretched back to another place entirely, a world without Arcana.

Mirari didn’t interrupt. She leaned forward slightly, as if committing every word to memory.
She put the open faced sandwich she biting at back down, as if conceding that multi-tasking was too difficult at the moment. 

When I finished, she leaned back, putting her palms together and up to her lips in a thoughtful expression.
"Another world," she said, almost to herself. "Not another life, but another... plane. And a goddess, Omnis herself, sending you here."
Her eyes narrowed in thought, not suspicion.
"I’ve studied the myths, the fragments. Omnis is a name older than our oldest records. If she truly placed you here, then..."

She trailed off, then her gaze shifted.
"Tell me about your world. Everything you can remember. Start with what matters to you."
