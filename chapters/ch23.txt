Mirari leaned back in her chair, her Dirma glimmering faintly in the lamplight.

"Billions of these gates, all asking their petty questions in unison... and somehow that becomes the voice of your machines."

I nodded. "A loom weaving threads. A colony of ants, each following only one rule, yet together they build a city. The AND gate is that rule. Yes, they're incredibly simple, but that makes them reliable. As long as your instructions are correct, your machine will produce results that are correct." 

For a moment, she was silent, her gaze fixed on the stones as if she were seeing them as something more. Then she looked up at me with that bright, almost dangerous curiosity of hers.

"Now, in order to build our machine together, we need a way to bring Arcana into play," I declared.

"Do you remember a few weeks ago when we went to repair the lighting in the center of the city? You did... something. And the glass was lit with bright patterns like sparks or a flame. What was that?" I asked

"It's a kind of manifestation of Arcana. It's no different than moving objects or creating changes in energy like a gust of wind or lighting a fire," she explained.

"Did you come up with it? It's brilliant!" I exclaimed. I had already come to grow in awe of Mirari, but she exceeded my expectations once again.

She shook her head.
"As much as I like you looking at me in that way, I can't take credit for this. The change in the form of Arcana is something you will come to master in time, but the concept was borrowed from nature long before me. Come with me and I'll show you."

We descended a narrow stairwell at the rear of the Arcanum. The air grew cooler with each step, a dampness threading through the stone. The silence pressed against my ears until only the echo of our footfalls remained.

At the bottom, the passage opened into a labyrinth that stole my breath.

"These are the roots of the World Tree," Mirari stated.

Solid arches that looked as dense as stone and covered in moss occupied the center of the tunnels. 
From them, crystalline growths jutted outward - milky, pearl-colored lattices that gleamed softly in the torchlight.
They pulsed faintly, as though some unseen current flowed through them. 
The catacombs stretched farther than sight, the pale glow vanishing into the dark like constellations swallowed by horizon.

I swallowed, struck by the immensity of it. "The crystals. They're just like the tablets."

Her eyes glittered in the pearlescent glow as she nodded. I was glad that she was my guide for such a wonderous experience.

"The crystals were known long before I was born. But I realized that they could be rearranged to hold the form of Arcana that you imbue into them. I can take credit for the tablets, but they are really just imitations of what was already present," she clarified.

"That's genius. YOU are genius," I praised.

Although I couldn't be sure in the dimly lit caverns, I thought I saw Mirari's cheeks turn rosy as she brushed her silvery locks behind her ear.
