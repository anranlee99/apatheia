The southern edge of the city was quieter than most places I had seen in Apatheia. 
The streets thinned into hard-packed earth, and beyond them the river spread wide and slow, its banks braided with reeds. 
A new bridge was being raised here - not grand, nothing like the ancient spans closer to the heart of the city, but sturdy enough to carry carts and foot traffic across without the risk of being swept away in flood season.

Mirari and I had been asked to survey the foundation stones. The builders had set them in place with ordinary labor, but the current’s strength made them wary. 
Arcana could keep the stones in place, bind them against erosion, but it needed to be set with precision or the river would simply shear through the work in a season.

Mirari knelt on the riverbank, her braid trailing over her shoulder, one hand pressed lightly against the pale block beneath the water’s surface. 
Lines of light shimmered across it as she coaxed the resonance into balance. I stood beside her, tablet in hand, sketching the currents the way she taught me: arcs and vectors, a ledger of motion. 
To anyone else it must have looked absurd - two scholars fussing with quills while the masons sweated with rope and pulley - but the foreman nodded to us with the kind of trust Mirari seemed to inspire everywhere she went.

We worked like that for some time. The water lapped steadily. 
Sunlight burned against the river’s surface, fractured into glittering shards. I was just marking the last of the flow-lines when I heard hurried footsteps on the packed earth behind us.

A runner - a boy, his chest heaving, dust clinging to his bare arms - skidded to a stop. He bowed quickly, but his words tumbled out before he could catch his breath.

"Master Mirari. The Primarch summons you. At once."

Mirari’s hand stilled on the stone. She looked up at me, and for the first time in many sols I saw no trace of her usual levity. 
Only the faint tightening at the corner of her mouth, as if she already knew what this meant.

Five of the seven thrones were occupied now, their crescent arc bent like the horizon of some vast world. At the center sat a figure I had only ever known through myth and murmurs.

The Primarch.

At first glance, he looked no older than a boy - slight of frame, not yet grown into the weight of the chair he occupied. But the illusion ended there. 
His body was a living tapestry. Dirma covered him wholly, no bare skin left to speak of. Every inch was crowded with fractals upon fractals, spiraling, curling, stretching into infinity. 
Where most bore clean, sharp edges, his had weathered into scar-like ridges, as if the patterns themselves had worn grooves into his flesh across countless lives. The ink did not just sit upon him; it had remade him.

His eyes were what struck me hardest. Black from corner to corner, like polished obsidian, but at their centers burned pupils of stark white. In them was no softness, no hesitation - only the cold certainty of a star glimpsed from a thousand leagues away.

The chamber’s light caught on his skin in strange ways, scattering as though even it could not decide how to interpret the endless labyrinth etched into him.

The Councilmen beside him were monumental in their own right, Dirma coiled thick across their faces and arms, their bearing older than stone. 
But beside the Primarch, they seemed diminished - like satellites at the feet of a singular planet.

Even the air felt different. Dense, charged, as though each breath I drew had to pass through him first.

Mirari bowed deeply, her braid brushing the floor. I followed, though I could not tear my gaze from him.

The Primarch did not move. He only watched. And in that watching, I felt as if every secret I had ever carried was already laid bare.

"And you are?" the Primarch asked.

His voice was young - clear, unbroken - yet it carried the weight of ages. The sound of it filled the chamber like a stone dropped into still water, rippling out until even the silence seemed to lean toward him.

"Th-this is Euler," Mirari said quickly, her words tumbling over each other. "My apprentice. He is only a Velar, but he has aided me greatly in my work. I brought him because-because I-"

Her composure, usually unshakable, faltered under that gaze.

"Peace, child," the Primarch decreed, "we'll address him in due time. First, catch me up on your work. Give us some privacy." 

Only then did I notice how many had been in the chamber. Servants and scribes: perhaps two dozen souls I had mistaken for stone and shadow - all moving at once. They bowed as they withdrew, their retreating footsteps echoing like a tide pulling back from shore.

When the doors closed, the silence was absolute. Only the Council, Mirari, and I remained.

Mirari bowed her head low. "At your command, Primarch. The Arcanum continues its charge as you set forth: to gather what can be known, to study the veins of Arcana and the nature of Dirma, and to press toward an answer to the Drift. We scour the records and test what patterns endure. The scholars labor tirelessly, though many confess they cannot yet see the shape of what they build."

She glanced up at him, then down again. "The heart of the Drift eludes me. We do not yet grasp its root. But I will not falter in the charge you gave me."

The Primarch regarded her without motion, those black eyes and white pupils unreadable.
