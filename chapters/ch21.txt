The master and tutor lingered by the doorway as Mirari adjusted a stack of tablets with a flick of her hand. 
She didn’t look at them when she spoke.

"He works for me now," she said, as if it were a matter already decided.

The tutor shifted uneasily. "The Council instructed he was to follow the Nova curriculum-"

Mirari waved her fingers in a dismissive spiral, the air itself seeming to sigh in agreement with her. "Yes, yes. Am I not the authority when it comes to the curriculum?"

The master gave a weary look, as though this was hardly the first time he’d seen her draft new rules into existence. 
He rubbed at his temple, then inclined his head in reluctant acceptance.

Their eyes turned to me. I half-expected some ceremonial test or at least a question to prove my worth. Instead, Mirari tilted her head and said simply:
"Come along, Euler."

That was it. No oath, no inked name in a ledger. Just a declaration, and the weight of centuries behind her to make it true.

As I followed her out, the shift was apparent. The apprentice in the hall didn’t address me as "child" or "Velar." 
They looked at me the way one looks at a junior scribe carrying another’s notes - inconsequential, yes, but part of the work.

For the first time in this life, I had a job.

*** 

A few days after Mirari showed me the basics of how the Arcanum functions as an organization, she deemed it suitable to take me on an assignment assisting in her duties.

We set out for the center of town in a carriage that Mirari drew with Arcana absent-mindedly.

The further inward we rode, the quieter the city became.
I hadn’t noticed it on my first visit to the Council with Tariel, perhaps because I had no perspective then. 

Here the stonework was grand, older than anything I’d yet seen. 
Columns thick as towers rose in neat ranks, their tops swallowed by the canopy of what I now knew to be called the World Tree. 
Bridges of pale stone arched over dry canals. What must once have been fountains sat stagnant, their basins embroidered with moss.

It felt desolated but not abandoned, as if the youth had all been drafted off to war - though I knew it was peaceful here. 
The few people we passed moved with the casual pace of those who had never known it differently.

The plaza near the World Tree was hushed, the way a great hall feels after a festival has long ended. 
At its center stood a vast structure of stone and bronze, its ribs jutting skyward like the frame of a broken colossus.
The machine’s heart was a cluster of crystal conduits, arranged in spirals that pointed toward the canopy above.

Even at a glance I could tell its purpose: the crystals caught sunlight from the high branches and bent it, amplifying and scattering it through the avenues below. 
Without it, these inner streets would drown in the tree’s endless shadow.
Such a grand machination for such humble usage seemed a bit ostentatious to me.

Today, only half the spirals glowed. The rest lay dim and cracked, leaving long corridors of darkness stretching between the colonnades.

A pair of Arcanists knelt by the base, their hands pressed against the conduits. 
Sweat slicked their brows, their Dirma faintly glowing as they strained, but the light faltered the moment they pulled away, sputtering like a flame about to die.

By now I had learned the art of sizing someone up in terms of Dirma.
It was customary for those with less Dirma to wear clothing that revealed more skin, to make their identity visible at a glance. 
For those old enough to bear markings across their faces, hands, or feet, such displays were unnecessary. 
It wasn’t a classist tradition, only a pragmatic one.

These two were richer in Dirma than I, but still relatively youthful in this world. 
If I was a toddler in Earth years, they were something like twenty - though in truth they had likely lived millennia already.

They rose when Mirari approached, bowing with exhausted respect. 
One of them, his face drawn tight, said: "Master Mirari. We’ve held it as long as we can, but our Arcana isn’t enough. Not for all the rings."

Mirari placed her palm against the bronze frame. For a moment she said nothing. Then she drew a breath, and the air itself seemed to stiffen.

The crystals flared. One by one, the dead spirals roared back to life, each bloom of light cascading into the next until the whole array blazed like a crown of stars.

The attendants staggered back from the sudden brilliance. The shadows across the plaza retreated at once, alleys and arches awash in gold as if the sun itself had stepped closer.

Mirari held the glow steady with one hand as casually as if she were holding open a door. Her braid swayed in the light, silver strands catching like wire in a forge.

Then, with a flex of her fingers, she released it. The radiance softened but held.

The two Arcanists exhaled, faces caught between awe and relief. "Thank you, Master," one murmured, voice hoarse.

Mirari gave only a small nod and turned away, as though she’d merely righted a chair.

At this point, I had learned to hold no preconceptions about Arcana, but this - this was a textbook example of magic.
Not the casual gestures of levitating baskets or conjuring bread. 
This was power like a hand pressed against the sun itself.

I stared up at the blazing conduits, still echoing with the hum of her Arcana. 
For the first time, I realized what it meant to call someone like her indispensable.
The others weren’t fools. They were skilled. Disciplined. But without her, and others rich in Arcana, this entire quarter of the city would slowly sink into darkness.

***

We didn’t stop long to admire her work. Mirari led me further, circumventing the World Tree.

Another plaza opened ahead, this one dominated by a broad circular pool. 
Once it must have been a fountain, or something like it - though not decorative. 
The water within trembled in uneven pulses, cloudy where it should have been clear. A haze of stagnant air clung above the basin, heavy with the smell of mildew.

Two Arcanists stood at the rim, their arms extended over the water. 
Concentric ripples formed where their power pressed against the surface, but as soon as they faltered, the pool began to churn again, the haze thickening.

When they saw Mirari, they lowered their hands, relief written plain across their faces.
"Master Mirari," one said quickly. "We’ve tried to keep the currents balanced, but it slips the moment we rest. The air grows foul again."

I frowned. "What is it meant to do?"

Mirari answered without breaking stride. "It is connected to the aqueducts under the city. The device here filters and cleans the water, and the fountain serves as a way to observe the quality of the water."

She stepped to the edge, stretched out her hand, and the basin convulsed. 
The cloudy surface folded in on itself, layer by layer, until the water turned clear as polished glass. 
The haze lifted in a single breath, vanishing into currents that rushed outward into the plaza.

The attending Arcanists swayed on their feet, blinking as if they’d suddenly woken.

Mirari lowered her hand with no more concern than if she’d brushed dust from her sleeve.

I watched the pool settle into a mirror, its clarity almost unnatural. 
To the others it was just another repair, but I couldn’t help but think: every time she did this, she was buying the city a little more time.

I went home that day with a clear understanding that despite the ease and casualness in our conversations, Mirari's abilities were nothing less than those of a god.
