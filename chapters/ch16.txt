The master’s weathered fingers tapped against the edge of the table. "That is a simple way to put it, but the principle is not simple at all... I think I know who will want to hear this."

He stood, motioning for me to follow. The tutor glanced at me once, as if to say brace yourself, and we threaded our way through another corridor of polished wood and crystal alcoves.
I caught up to her side. "What was that look about?"

She gave a small, tight smile. "Mirari. If there’s an answer no one else can find, she’s usually the one who has it. It's not an understatement to say that the Arcanum is hers."

A pause, then, softer: "She’s brilliant. But many find a need to... adjust to her." She let the last word hang in the air like the scent of something you can’t quite place.

The further we went, the fewer people we saw. The chatter of other pupils faded until the only sound was the distant hum of the Arcanum itself. 

We stopped before a door carved from pale, veined stone.
The master rapped twice; the sound was swallowed instantly, as if the room beyond had no air. Then he pushed it open.

Inside was... not what I expected from this mysterious authority figure of the Arcanum.
The chamber was half study, half storm. Tall stacks of crystal tablets leaned precariously, some arranged with obsessive precision, others abandoned mid-order, as though their caretaker had been called away by some urgent thought. 

A faint shimmer of Arcana clung to the air, the aftertaste of spells hurriedly cast and abandoned.

At the center stood a girl - or at least, the body of one - framed by the light from a high window. Dirma coiled across her arms and throat in fractal filigree, every line and curve too intricate to follow, the sort of detail that spoke of centuries layered upon centuries.

She was muttering to herself, the kind of muttering that was less complaint and more an argument with the universe.
"...three centuries of indexing, and now they tell me the entire archive of pre-Tanai Dirma morphology is ‘misplaced’? Misplaced? How do you misplace two dozen crystal tablets the size of paving stones?"

The master cleared his throat. "Master Mirari."

She turned, eyes flicking over us with distracted irritation. "What is it? I’m trying to-"
Her gaze fell on me. "Oh. A Nova?"

"Velar," the master corrected. "But not... quite."

"Not quite?" she said, as if half-daring him to justify the interruption.

"He asked me something I had never considered, and I thought you might have something to say about it," the master said, stepping aside so I was in full view.

Her brows lifted, not much - just enough to signal interest. "Let’s hear it."

I repeated the question: If a computation with Arcana can be done by brute force, can it also be done with less Arcana if the method is clever enough?

The shift was immediate. The annoyance evaporated. 
Her eyes lit like she’d been handed a puzzle-box she’d never seen before.
She stepped closer, Dirma catching the light in an iridescent ripple. "Explain."

I gave her the diagonal-across-the-field analogy. She didn’t interrupt. She didn’t even blink.

When I finished, she laughed softly - not mocking, but delighted. "You’re right. It’s not usually considered. And if you can’t measure the shape of the problem without solving it, the savings might be nothing... but if you can..." She trailed off, the rest of the thought clearly already racing ahead in her mind.

Her gaze sharpened suddenly, focusing on me rather than the idea. "What made you think of this? Novas don’t think like this. And you’re not quite Velar either, are you?"

I hesitated. "That’s... complicated."

She regarded me for a long moment, the corners of her mouth curving ever so slightly. "Good."

Then she turned toward the master and the tutor. "I’ll take him."

The tutor cleared her throat. "The Council instructed that he should follow the Nova curriculum so he can learn about our world."

"Of course," Mirari said easily. "I’ll personally see to his studies."

The master gave a bemused expression that said nothing about Mirari's character was much of a surprise anymore. 
He gave a small nod, and the tutor relaxed.

Mirari looked back at me. "Have you had lunch? We'll talk over food."
