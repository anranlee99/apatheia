The morning after, I woke to the gentle weight of her arm still draped across me. 
The air of the Arcanum was thick with the mingled scents of parchment, smoke, and her skin. 
The taste of amber lingered on my lips, softened now with the warmth of her kiss.

Mirari still muttered at her tablets, still teased me when I overreached with Arcana, still pressed water into my hands when my reserves faltered. 
But beneath it all, there was a warmth that hadn’t been there before - a private acknowledgment, quiet but unshakable, that we belonged to one another.

The curve of her hip brushing against mine when she passed, the brush of her hair against my cheek when she leaned close, the way her gaze lingered a little longer than before - every detail carried a new, electric gravity.

We didn’t speak of it. We didn’t need to. 
The work kept its own hours, and we returned to it as we always had, only now the silence between thoughts felt inhabited.

The Hollows spread before us, ribbed with stone and veined through with the roots of the World Tree. 
Light shimmered faintly along the crystal growths that clung to them, each pulse a breath of something older and steadier than either of us.

On the bench lay our latest lattice, its collar grafted neatly into one of the roots. 
Slender cords of crystal ran from the Tree’s vein to the array, a design we had tried and failed to tame more times than I cared to count. 
This was no new idea. Only the latest iteration of the same goal we have now devoted almost two decades towards. 

From the first day, the flaw had been obvious. 
Arcana could be bent into logic - latches that held, gates that decided, counters that ticked forward - but only so long as someone was there to drive it. 
Every step, every pulse, demanded the hand of a Nova or Velar, bleeding their strength into the lattice until it stuttered and failed. 
That was Arcana’s nature: potent. But from someone used to the persistent obedience of machines on Earth? Extremely tedious. 

So our work was never just about teaching crystal to compute. It was about breaking Arcana free of the driver. 
A machine could not grow if it always needed someone watching over its shoulder. 
If we wanted more than toys and clever puzzles, it had to run itself.

We began with clumsy taps - jagged cuts into the roots that flooded the lattice one moment and starved it the next. 
Half the time the current tore our work apart before it even began to answer. 
Other times, it dribbled away uselessly, still leaving me trembling with the burden of holding the flow steady.

It may come as a surprise to you that despite an unfathomably long lineage of knowledge in this world, the mechanistic understandings of working with Arcana as a substrate was not readily available. 
But keep in mind that without the addition of using logic as the puppet master, the solidified Arcana was no more useful than any other rock.

Mirari leaned over her tablet, lips moving faintly as she read. I sat opposite, quill forgotten at my side. Instead, I let the thin lines of Arcana spill from my fingertips, arranging themselves into careful strokes across the vellum. Letters etched themselves neatly, black ink filling grooves that had not been there a moment ago.

"You don’t even bother with the quill anymore," Mirari said suddenly. Her voice was soft, but I caught the brightness in it. "When you first tried, you nearly jumped out of your skin every time the lines sparked."

I glanced at her, amused. "That was a long time ago."

"Seventeen years," she corrected instantly, looking up with a small, eager grin. "Seventeen years, and now you make it look... natural. Effortless."

Her expression lingered on me in a way that made her seem younger than I ever thought her. Expectant, almost. Like she was proud and wanted me to notice it.

I shrugged, letting the Arcana fade. "I suppose I’ve had a good teacher."

Her eyes softened, the grin threatening to bloom into something bigger. "Do you mean that?"

"Of course I do," I said.

She laughed quietly and shook her head, brushing a silver lock behind her ear. "No one’s ever said that to me. Not like that. They say I’m impossible to follow, or that I talk too fast, or that my work is too strange to understand. But you... you make me feel like I’m worth learning from."

I felt my chest tighten at the honesty in her tone. "You are."

The way her face lit up at that - a smile breaking free before she tried to hide it in her hand - was almost girlish. She looked away quickly, but not before I caught it.

It was not enough to master Arcana’s flow - that was the folly of so many in this world. 
They bent it to their will and called the result success, but never bothered to measure, to test, to learn what made one attempt succeed and another collapse.
Wasted efforts were everywhere, and asking for aid from those well practiced without any attempt on their own is a first instinct.

On Earth, even the simplest experiments demanded rigor: controls, variables, records. 
Here, intuition had been king for millennia, and intuition had left them stranded.

So I measured. Every pulse, every flicker of crystal light, every collapse of a gate was etched into my ledgers. 
Angles, distances, thicknesses, the exact pitch of resonance when a vein of crystal was stressed too far - I recorded them all. 
It was tedious, yes, but it was also the only way to bring order to a discipline that had always lived on the edge of chaos.

Mirari teased me for it at first, for filling volumes with what she called "the notes of a scribe gone mad."
Yet she never asked me to stop. In time, I caught her adding her own observations in the margins, her hand steadier than mine.

Seventeen years. Enough time for a boy to become a man, for a friendship to become something unspoken but certain. Enough time for failure after failure to carve away at illusion until only stubborn conviction remained.

Our lattices had grown finer. Where once we hacked clumsily at the roots, now we coaxed them, easing flows into stable channels that lasted more than a moment. 
We had devised counters that could tick a dozen beats before burning out, gates that remembered their state even after the current passed. 
Small things, laughable by the standards of the machines I once knew, but unprecedented here.

The plans had grown bolder, too. No longer was I content with clever toys or a single isolated circuit. 
I wanted a lattice that could endure for years, that could calculate without constant tending, that could take instructions and carry them out unsupervised.

A true machine.

And though we had not yet succeeded, I could feel the path beneath my feet. We were closer now than ever before.
