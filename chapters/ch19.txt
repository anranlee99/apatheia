"So, my question," I asked, focusing the conversation, "Is there a way to use Arcana more efficiently?"

Mirari’s brow lifted slightly, like I’d just offered her a puzzle.
"Efficiently..." she repeated. "I suppose we would call it talent."

"Talent?" I asked, "I thought that what you could do was directly proportional to how much Dirma you have?" 

"It's true for things like how big of a rock you are able to lift," Mirari started, "but people definitely have different affinities for different tasks."

"And what determines your affinities?" I probed eagerly.

Mirari shrugged.
"Interest? Practice?" she wondered. 

"It's only natural that if you do something a thousand times, you'd be better at it than a novice," she continued.

She leaned back slightly, eyes still on me. "Some can shape flame as easily as breathing but struggle to coax a plant to grow. Others can weave an illusion sharp enough to fool their own reflection, yet fumble a simple levitation. It’s not about raw power. It’s about the fit between your mind and the work."

"And what can you do with Arcana exactly?"

Mirari made a quirky expression as if to say she was determining if this was a trick question. 

"Arcana follows three simple measures. Break them, and the work collapses or bleeds you dry."

She lifted one finger.
"Form - how clearly you can describe the outcome in your mind. The simpler the instruction, the easier the shaping. ‘Boil this water’ is one instruction, and any novice could do it. But say ‘boil it until it’s warm enough to drink, but only at the edges of the cup, and keep the middle cool for the flowers I’ll put in later’-now you’ve multiplied the effort. The Arcana has to hold all those boundaries at once."

A second finger.
"Scale - how much matter or distance you’re working with. This one’s obvious. Moving a pebble is easy. Moving a house is something even the Council wouldn’t waste themselves on unless they had to."

A third finger.
"Change - how far the target must be shifted from what it already is. Heating a hot pan hotter is cheap. Turning a seed into a full-grown tomato in seconds costs more, because you’re dragging it through days of change all at once."

She picked up the folded scrap of cloth and let it unfurl in the air.
"Form, Scale, Change - every working has all three. Most everyday magic is trivial because one or more of those measures is tiny. That’s why no one thinks about it. You can stitch cloth together with Arcana, but unless you need it done instantly, it’s easier to do it by hand. Weaving a whole bolt? Now your Form is high, your Change is high, and your Scale might be high too. It becomes work."

She gave a faint shrug. "It’s also why I can pluck ripe tomatoes out of the air without breaking a sweat. The Form is simple:‘make this plant bear fruit.’ The Scale is small. Just a single stem at a time. And the Change... well, plants already want to grow. You’re just hurrying them along."

"I'm sure you know these things to some degree already. How do you feel when you use it?" she asked.

"I've never used it. I don't know how. I'm not even sure I can?" I admitted, suddenly uncomfortably aware of just how abnormal I was in this world.

"Oh, right. Well, not to worry, you can try now," she spoke with the easy confidence of someone certain the result was inevitable.

Mirari twirled her finger and a piece of parchment glided from a nearby shelf onto the table between us. 

"Lift this piece of paper without touching it," she instructed.

"... How?" I said, slightly frustrated by the quality of the instruction.

"Just imagine lifting it," she assured. 

Before she even finished the instruction, the piece of paper lifted into the air. 

I could feel it. Not exactly like touch, but close.
A strange, in-between sensation I had no words for. 
English had never needed a term for it, and I’d never experienced anything like it before.

Except... I had. I couldn’t place it right away, but there was something familiar about the tug, the way the parchment seemed to rest in an invisible grip.

"See? How did you do that?" she asked. 

"I guess... I just pictured holding it? Like it was in my palm," I answered.

"There you go. And what if you picked it up by the corner?" she asked, half rhetorically.

I pictured it dangling from one corner, and it obeyed, rotating neatly to match.

As soon as I pictured it, the paper rotated to become dangling by the corner I imagined picking it up by. 
It wasn’t like stray thoughts could trigger it - purely abstract imaginings didn’t cause chaos around me. 

It required an exact intention. But it was something I now realized I always possessed. 
Honestly, it was very similar to sitting on the toilet and... channeling the urge?
You just know how to do it without needing to fire muscles consciously.

The familiarity nagged at me until it finally clicked.
This is exactly the sensation I had felt when I tried to search the internet when I was still unable to walk and talk. 
I had avoided it because it drained me so thoroughly at the time and I had no real use until now.

Mirari’s gaze stayed on me for a moment longer, the faintest crease forming between her brows. Then, almost casually, she said,
"My turn for a question."

"Alright," I said warily.

"You’ve told me little things about your old world - scraps, really. But I want to know about this... technology. The way you speak of it, it’s like a form of Arcana without Arcana. I want to know how it works. How to wield it."

Her tone wasn’t idle curiosity - it was intent, the same way she’d looked at me when the paper first rose off the table.

I leaned back slightly, caught off guard by the directness of it. "That’s... a big question."

"Then take your time," she said, folding her arms. "If it’s as powerful as you’ve implied, I’d like to understand it."

I nodded slowly, already feeling the weight of the problem.
In my world, technology was so woven into daily life that you didn’t explain it - most just used it. 
Even those who understood only fragments could still accept how a phone worked without knowing a thing about particle physics. The forms were familiar; the details could be ignored.

But Mirari had no such half-formed notions to lean on.

I gathered my thoughts on how to best explain a concept that was ubiquitous where I came from... with no analogies she could anchor herself to.
