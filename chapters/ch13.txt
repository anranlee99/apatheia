A few weeks passed after my first visit to the Council. 
I was still less than a year old, but I could walk. 
My legs were unsteady and my balance questionable, but in a world where minor physical injuries were little more than a nuisance, someone with my body walking around was commonplace.

One thing I had learned by now was that my size mattered far less here than it would have on Earth. 
In this world, most people who looked like children were not children at all. 
They were adults often older than anyone I had met in my old life. 

That meant no one spoke down to me. Tariel never did, and neither did anyone else. 
Even strangers addressed me the way you might address an equal in a casual conversation. 
There was no singsong tone, no exaggerated vocabulary, no assumption that I would not understand. 
Here, a small frame was no marker of inexperience, just a frame.

The world itself reflected that. 
Streets, buildings, and public spaces were shaped with the understanding that many bodies here were small. 
Doors had low handles or were light enough to push with one hand.
Steps were shallow and frequent, never the long, knee-high kind you might find on Earth. 
Counters were often built with an upward sland, and started low enough that most people could see over them, and for the few that were not, a simple wooden step or small ladder sat to the side. 
It was not perfect for everyone. Those with low Dirma still found some tasks harder, but the physical world itself rarely shut you out.

Days here were slow in a way that Earth never managed. 
There were no schedules beyond what people decided for themselves. 
The sun rose and set, the moons traced their cycles, but the rhythm of life came from the whims of its people.

Tariel, for example, had a vocation, though calling it a job felt like a stretch by Earth standards. 
She was what they called a fabricator, which in practice meant she made things for people who either lacked the skill or the Dirma to make them themselves. 
One day she might be shaping a set of stone tiles for a new courtyard, the next she would be weaving an entire bolt of fabric out of thin air. 
She did it all with a patient, practiced magic that made the work look like a performance more than labor.

There was no schedule, no quota, no boss. 
People came to her with requests and she decided which ones she felt like doing. 
If she was in no mood for work, she simply did not take any. 
Once you had lived enough lives, it was easy to afford an existence like that: part craftsperson, part retiree. 
The wealth, connections, and accumulated skill from past incarnations meant you could glide through a life without ever straining yourself. 
Most of the people who seemed to work with any sort of dedication were Novas or Velar, those still in their first or second lives, still driven by a lack of Dirma and basic funds for living. 

Vendors passed along the street in no great hurry, their wares drifting behind them in small floating carts. 
Most of them sold food prepared minutes before, still steaming, not because refrigeration was impossible but because magic made fresh cooking trivial. 
A baker down the road baked loaves in batches of one, each one conjured in its own heat-haze bubble until the crust browned to perfection. 
Customers bought them the moment they were done, coins and words exchanged almost as an afterthought.

Even the simplest tasks could reveal an almost shocking laziness among those rich in Dirma. 
Doors that anyone could open with a hand were instead swung wide with a flick of magic from across the room. 
Neighbors sent flying letters tied to baskets holding coins, and the baskets would drift through the streets to a shop. 
When the goods were loaded, the basket would simply take to the air again and return home without its owner ever leaving their seat. 
Watching it for the first time, I could not decide if it was convenience taken to an art form or just a public display of how little effort they were willing to expend.

It was a beautiful place to be idle, which is exactly what most people were. 
Not lazy, not exactly; just unconcerned with the idea of having to be anywhere, or to get anything done, unless they felt like it. 
I began to understand why the Arcanum was seen the way it was. 
The idea of optimizing or chasing efficiency was not incomprehensible to them. 
They could understand it if you explained it, but it simply was not something that entered their minds on its own.

For me, though, every little thing was another piece of a puzzle. I didnâ€™t yet know what the picture was, but I was starting to collect the edges.
