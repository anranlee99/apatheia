If you asked me back on Earth to imagine the heart of magical learning in another world, I would have pictured something like the Library of Alexandria and MIT rolled into one. 
Towering halls of ivory, scholars in flowing robes debating the nature of the universe, and students rushing through corridors with their arms full of dusty tomes.

The Arcanum was nothing like that.

It was large, yes, and imposing even. 
But the feeling it gave off was not one of prestige or ambition. It was more like walking into a post office that had been expanded a thousand times its size. 
The air was thick with the quiet hum of work being done, but it was the kind of work that existed because someone had to do it, not because anyone was excited about it.

They kept records there. A lot of them. Not in scrolls or books, but in flat tablets of something like crystal mirror.
To use them, you would coax a faint label or tag to appear on the surface with a small application of magic, but the real contents were locked away. 
To read them, you had to pull the information into your own mind through Arcana. It was not like looking at a screen. 
It was more like pouring a book directly into your memory, page by page, image by image. 
The process was instantaneous once begun, but the magic required was proportional to the contents retrieved and stored.

There were research wings too. Not the kind that might be bursting with experiments and breakthroughs, but slow, deliberate investigations into things that no one in the general population cared about. 
The nature of Dirma, for example. How they formed, whether their growth could be altered. 
The practical applications of such research were minimal, since most people simply accepted their Dirma as part of who they were.
The purpose of this research was mostly practical, with little passion or vigor. The specific goals of research were essentially commissioned quests. 

Then there was the work with Arcana, the underlying principles that made magic possible. 
The theory existed, but almost no one outside the Arcanum bothered with it. 
Everyone could use magic, and use it they did. 
Anything that would require labor or technology in my world was handled here with a casual gesture and a few words - hauling stone, lighting a street, curing an illness, even farming.
To give you an idea of why it wasn't seen as a particular interesting walk of life, it might be akin to studying how the number of pages of an electrical schematic for a city's power grids affects the time it takes for an emergency response.
Practical, but extremely dry for most.

One of the more unusual duties of the Arcanum was memory editing. Not for secrecy or politics, but for comfort. 
When people grew old, the sheer volume of their memories could become a mental burden. 
Those with the means would come to the Arcanum to have certain memories archived and stored. 
It was not erasure. The memories could be restored later if desired, but the act of putting them aside made the mind more dexterous. 
As a being with less than half a century of memories, the necessity was incomprehensible to me.

On Earth, a place like this would have been the pinnacle of human achievement. 
The best minds would have fought for a chance to work here. 
In this world, it was nothing of the sort. To the average person, the Arcanum was just another branch of public service, like a courthouse or a census office. 
It was respectable, but not inspiring. No child dreamed of growing up to be an archivist or a Dirma researcher.

Most people simply did what they wanted with their lives. 
When magic could provide almost anything on demand, there was no ladder to climb, no scarcity to force people into competition. 
In that kind of world, the Arcanum was a curiosity more than an aspiration.
A place you visited if you needed something unusual, or if you had a problem you could not solve yourself.

For me, it would become something else entirely. 
But at the time, I saw it for what it was: a strange blend of library, help desk, and laboratory, humming quietly in the background of a society that barely noticed it was there.
