Her eyes fixed on me with an intensity that felt almost physical, like standing in the beam of a warm sun after too long in shadow.
It wasn’t just attention - it was interest, sharpened and bright, the kind I’d come to associate with only Novas in this world. 
No, perhaps this was something I merely thought I saw in Novas but was only ever present in my old world.

She looked youthful, and of course she was, physically, but it was her demeanor that struck me.
In a place where most people carried a stale, geriatric mannerism towards life, Mirari’s wonder made her seem impossibly alive.

She leaned forward, elbows resting lightly on her knees. "So... in your world, when you die, that’s it? No Tanai, no return?"

"Permanent," I said. "We had myths and religions that promised something afterward, but nothing anyone could prove. Most of us lived as though this was our only run."

Her eyes widened slightly. "That must make everything feel... sharper."

"It did. Urgency was baked into everything - careers, relationships, discoveries. If you didn’t do it in your lifetime, you might never see it done."

Mirari frowned thoughtfully. "And you had no understanding of Arcana?"

I shook my head. "It was our understanding that nothing of the sort existed. In fact, I still maintain the belief that there wasn't anything like that. People generally agreed that unless you had a reason to believe something, what you see is what you get. And we never saw anything like Arcana. I didn't, anyway." 

"So.. how did you live? I can hardly believe that you lived with little sophistication more than animals. Just in our brief time together I have come to believe as much," she inferred. I must admit that her deductive intuitions were respectable.

"Nothing that could conjure food or mend a wound instantly. If something broke, we fixed it with tools. If someone got sick, we used medicine, surgery - things that took time and skill."

Her gaze narrowed, not suspiciously, but like she was tracing the outline of something invisible. 
"That can’t be all," she said slowly. "You’ve spoken of your world with such precision, but here you make it sound... too easy. You must've had an edge over nature? What was it?"

"Technology," I said. "It’s... applied knowledge. We started with simple machines - levers, pulleys, wheels. Then we built engines. Telegraphs. Electricity grids. Eventually we learned how to store and process information - first with mechanical parts, then with electronics. We built computers that could do billions of calculations every second."

I found it interesting that the word for a billion, said literally, meant a thousand cubed. 

Her brow furrowed. "Billions? In seconds? What could you possibly need that much for?"

"Anything. Everything. Modeling the weather, predicting the path of disease outbreaks, searching for new medicines, calculating the stresses on a bridge before it’s built. And... playing games, sending messages instantly, watching stories. All through networks connecting the whole world."

She tilted her head. "So everyone had access to this power?"

"Pretty much, yes. My world was a lot less fair than this one. By the time I died, most of those around me carried a computer in their pocket more powerful than the ones we first sent into space. I loved it." 

"You talk about it," she said slowly, faintly smiling, "the way some people here talk about a lover." 

I blinked at her, caught off guard. "Do I?"

I let out a short laugh. "Well... you’re not wrong."

Her eyes lingered on me, curious and unblinking. "And what did you love about it? This... technology?"

"It wasn’t just the power of the machines," I said. "It was the ideas behind them. Every advance was the child of a thousand others - you could trace the lineage all the way back. Writing. Numbers. Tools. All of it stacked, piece on piece, until you could hold in your hand something that could run circles around the fastest minds alive. And half the magic was in the way people thought about problems - the tricks, the shortcuts, the proofs that made something impossible suddenly obvious."

"Technology was sometimes viewed as divisive, but not me. It not only connected you to people far away, but long ago as well. Whether they knew it or not, their ingenuity lived on, and served as an inspiration in my life."

I caught myself smiling faintly. "I loved reading the stories of the brightest minds of our world. Just the ones we bothered to remember, but made real through their works. Gauss, Newton, Turing, Lovelace... And of course, Euler!" 

Her head tilted. "Isn’t that your name?"

I hesitated, realizing I’d walked right into it. "Yeah. I... chose it. When I got here."

Her brows lifted just a fraction. "Why?"

I shrugged, looking down at the table for a moment. "He was the brightest of them all. Everything he touched turned to gold."

"I thought you said there was no magic?" 

"Not literally. He was what some would describe as a polymath. Everything discipline he wrote about was advanced. Sometimes by decades or centuries. I guess I wanted him known to this world too. In my opinion, he would've been a better ambassador to this world." 

"And," I added, with a half hearted smile, "it’s better than dragging around my old name. I feel no attachment to that name." 

She studied me for a long moment, like she was weighing whether to ask more. But she didn’t.

***

The passion came rushing back, not all at once, but in steady swells as the conversation carried, and I realized I had honestly forgotten what it felt like to care this much about an idea.

I realized how laughable the imagery of an infant and a middle schooler disgusting their passions must be, but my sentiment maintained.

When I finally paused for breath, she was smiling faintly.
"You’re... different," I said, the words slipping out before I thought better of them. "Not just here in the Arcanum. I mean - in this world. Even in my old world, people like you were rare. You make me want to explain things, and I didn’t think that was possible anymore."

Her smile didn’t fade, but something in her eyes shifted - a softness, and just the barest pinch of pain.
"It’s... a little lonely, sometimes," she admitted. "It's not that I've made enemies or that I feel unwelcome. But when you spend your days chasing ideas no one else thinks or cares to look for... it's isolating to say the least."

She leaned back slightly, gaze wandering to the tall window. "You can be surrounded by colleagues and still feel like the only one running toward something."

Her tone wasn’t bitter - more like she’d made peace with the fact, but peace didn’t mean the absence of ache.

Something in the moment made me want to say more, to bridge that gap she’d just exposed.
Instead, I found myself asking, "So... what about love? In this world, people seem to find each other, even across lives. I found the idea riveting when I first came."

Her mouth quirked in the corner, but it wasn’t quite a smile.
"Sometimes. The good couples do find each other again and again, no matter what bodies they’re born into - sometimes even if they’re not born compatible, they find ways to stay close. But it’s not everyone’s fate."
She looked down at her hands, tracing a fingertip over the edge of the table. "I’ve... never found such a person."

The way she said it carried no self-pity, but it lingered in the air between us.
