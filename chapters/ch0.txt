Do you have any hopes, dreams, or desires?
How strongly do you feel about it, if you had any at all?
Now compare that quantity to the likelihood of it being reality. 

I began life with vague notions of such desires. Over time, they sharpened. 
What started as fleeting thoughts materialized into solid concepts, with surfaces and curvatures that made them seem more tangible.
But as you mature, you find the fire that once lit the shape and texture of your dreams begins to dim.

Sensibility. Rationality. Good judgment.
These are the things that smother the fire.

I am not placing the realist on a pedestal above the dreamer.
But it's only fair to say that a precise understanding of reality cannot coexist with unwavering belief in one's dreams. 

Perhaps these conclusions were learned, perhaps I drew them myself. 
Regardless, they were the beliefs that ultimately led me to my demise on Earth.
