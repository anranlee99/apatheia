The climb up the temple steps felt endless. 
Each rise was as tall as her knees, and Tariel took them with a slow, deliberate rhythm, as though rushing would be some kind of insult to the building itself.

When we summited the last stairs of stairs, I tried to look up, but my still limited mobility and the sheer height of the doors made it difficult to make sense of their size.
Strange sigils, spiraling in and out of geometric order, covered their surface, almost like Dirma scaled to the size of giants.

As we approached the doors, the doors opened. Slowly, but but steady and smooth. 
It stood out to me that these doors or incomprehensible size showed no signs of friction as they swung open. 
No creaks or rumbling, and no arc on the ground marking their path. 
The engineering of the hinges must be extremely advance, I thought.  

Inside was a hall so vast it could have been carved into the hollow of a mountain. 
Suspended near the upper curve of the walls, each luminous sphere radiated with impossible uniformity. No shadows, no dimming, no scattering; rendering the vast chamber equally visible in all directions.

Tariel adjusted the sling on her back and walked with small, careful steps, as though she’d reverted to a much younger self in the presence of these walls. 
I could feel it in the set of her shoulders; not fear, but that deferential awe children have when visiting grandparents who’ve seen too much to be impressed by anything.

We came in front of a crescent shaped table, made of wood so solid it was indistinguishable from stone if not for the organic patterns that marked its age. 
Around it sat seven great thrones, but only four of which were occupied. 

The Councilmen were so covered in Dirma that it was easier to pick out patches of bare skin than to trace the patterns themselves. 
Their faces were almost entirely masked in living ink, fractals upon fractals, each detail crisp and perfect. 
They sat in chairs that looked more like grown roots than carved furniture, their posture relaxed but unshakably composed.

Tariel bowed deeply, lowering her head until her braid slid forward over her shoulder.
"Honored Council," she said, voice almost a whisper, "I bring news... news of Omnis.

No ripple of surprise passed over them. One elder, whose voice sounded like wind through stone, said simply:
"Speak."

Tariel explained everything — my sudden speech, the misunderstanding over my supposed status as a Velar, and finally, my claim that a goddess had sent me here. 
Her words carried the careful pacing of someone reading aloud from a sacred text, each sentence allowed to hang in the air before the next began.

When she finished, the hall was silent for a time.

At the distant end of the crescent table, a youthful-faced councilor tilted their head, the gesture carrying an ageless patience, Dirma at their throat shifting like mercury in slow current.
Their voice was light but measured.
"It has been many aeons since Omnis last walked among us."

A pause followed, settling into the vast chamber like dust in still air.

Next to the empty throne, which was a touch more ornate than the rest, sat a youthful-faced councilor who broke the silence.  
"Child," they began, "if no name was given to you, what shall we call you?"

For a moment, my mind went to my name on Earth.
Two syllables worn smooth by the ceaseless weather of life, like a stone in the riverbed of a wide chasm. 
But I felt no attachment to that name. The very reason I am here, perhaps prematurely, was because I was simply finished with that life, as one might set down a book whose ending they already know.
If I was going to carry a name in this world, I wanted it to mean something here.

I thought of the rare places on Earth I still enjoyed; pockets of brilliance the gray machinery of rules and structures could never reach. 
They were untamed, immune to the slow erosion that made the rest of life there feel so dull. 
Even in that world, where wonder was rationed and passion pressed into boxes, these sparks burned bright and whole. 
I thought of the goal that Omnis had assigned to me. 

"Euler," I said. "Call me Euler."

From beside the empty, ornate throne, the youthful-faced councilor spoke with the same calm detachment as before.
"Euler, is there a reason Omnis has sent you here?"

"I believe so," I said, "but She did not give me the full answer. Only that I would understand, in time."

The councilor gave the smallest of nods, the kind that could just as easily mean acknowledgment as dismissal.

"Then it is noted. The Primarch returns soon. When it is time, you will meet, and matters will continue. Is there anything else you need in the meantime?"

I glanced toward Tariel, unsure what I should even ask for in a world I barely understood. 
She answered for me, her voice almost tentative, as if making a request on behalf of a much younger sibling.
"He should learn," she said. "Although he has the appearance of a Velar, he did not live as a Nova before his first return. There are things he is expected to know, life would prove strange for him."

A councilor on the far end of the crescent inclined their head slowly.
"A Velar without a Nova’s life... yes. Such a path would be strange. And if Omnis sent him, it would be wise for him to understand our ways. Until Euler has adjusted, you will raise him as one does with Nova, Tariel."

Another councilor spoke up for the first time, "He will study at the Arcanum. See that he begins where the novices begin."

"Thank you for this honor, great Council," Tariel said, dipping in what I assume to be a curtsy, althought I could not tell from my position.

And just like that, the audience was over.

As we left, Tariel’s steps grew lighter, her posture returning to its usual ease.

"That was the most lively I've ever seen the Coucil," Tariel noted. 

It wasn’t sarcasm. I could tell she meant it, which somehow made it sound even more absurd.
